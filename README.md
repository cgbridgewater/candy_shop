## We decided to make an eCommerce which can be used for an array of different applications, in this case to sell candy.

# Admin Side

### We created an Admin side to be able to control inventory, with CRUD features along with adding a tick option to put items on sale. All of this is protected behind a hidden login/reg page. A fully operational version of this site would have the registration page removed and only a login page available.


<br/>

#### Registration page

#### Login page

<br/>
<br/>

### Once logged into the admin side, the landing page displays a view-all of all items on the site and quick view of category, stock, price and if its on sale. An option to search by name is also available. Clicking on item name takes you to the edit page, while clicking 'create' takes you to the page to add a new item to the site.

### The User side allowed customers to view all items, items by category and items on sale. Or the option to view one item with more detail about the item and other items of the same category.
